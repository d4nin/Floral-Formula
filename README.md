# Floral-Formula
School project for my Biology teacher.

This programme showcases (almost) every floral formula there is.
It shows the actual formula, and the explanation. Then it showcases images for the specific family you entered. (Specifically the graphic represantation, the fruit and the actual flower).

# How to launch
Copy the link of the repository and clone it:

Then open the folder where you cloned it in VSCode. Run it and enjoy!

PS: Don't forget to have "runinterminal" enabled!


# IMPORTANT!!
I am a student from Bosnia, and I am currently working on the Bosnian version of this project. Please wait until I finish with the Bosnian part until I can move onto the English version.

# NOTE: THE ENGLISH VERSION IS ABANDONED!
I had no intentions to make one in the first place, I'll keep updating and adding more floral formulas in Bosnian. 
**The English version is decpracated unless you want to work on it _yourself._**
